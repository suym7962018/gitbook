Partition Equal Subset Sum\nMedium\nDESCRIPTION\nGiven a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.\nNote:\n\nEach of the array element will not exceed 100.\nThe array size will not exceed 200.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [1, 5, 11, 5]\n\nOutput: true\n\nExplanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].\nExample 2:\nInput: [1, 2, 3, 5]\n\nOutput: false\n\nExplanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.\nSOLUTION\nApproach: Dynamic Programming\nFirst, calculate the sum of the array. If sum cannot be divisible by 2, the answer must be false. Otherwise, use dynamic programming matrix to store the result. It is a kind of 0/1 knapsack problem.\nDefine:\ndp[i][j] - whether the first i numbers can sum up to j.\nTake [2, 1, 3] for example, dp[2][0], dp[2][1], dp[2][2], dp[2][3] should be true. Because you can choose 1, 2, neither of them(0) or both of them(3).\ndp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] if you don't choose nums[i - 1] OR dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]] if you choose nums[i - 1].\nThe base cases are: \ndp[0][j] = false since it takes nothing;\ndp[i][0] = true since if not choose any numbers, sum is 0.\nReturn dp[nums.length][sum / 2]\n[2, 1, 3]  \n  0 1 2 3 \n0 T F F F\n1 T F T F\n2 T T T T\n3 T T T T\n\nclass Solution {\n    public boolean canPartition(int[] nums) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for(int num : nums) {\n            sum += num;\n        }\n        if(sum % 2 != 0)\n            return false;\n        int m = nums.length, n = sum / 2;\n        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[m + 1][n + 1];\n          //initialize\n        for(int i = 0; i = nums[i - 1]) \n                      //take it or leave it\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]];\n                else\n                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];\n            }\n        }\n        return dp[m][n];\n    }\n}\n\nComplexity Analysis\n\nTime Complexity: O(n^2)\nSpace Complexity: O(n^2)\n\n"}}}
