Two Sum\nEasy\nDESCRIPTION\nGiven an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.\nYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\nExample:\nGiven nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,\n\nBecause nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,\nreturn [0, 1].\nSOLUTION\nApproach 1: Brute Force\nLoop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to target - x.\nclass Solution {\n    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        for(int i = 0; i \nComplexity Analysis\n\nTime Complexity: O(n^2)\nSpace Complexity: O(1)\n\nApproach 2: Hash Table\nTo improve the time complexity, we need to find a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. We can reduce the look up time from O(n) to O(1) by using hash table. It can look up in O(1) time. \nIn first iteration, we add each element's value and its index to the table. Then in second iteration, we check if the element's complement exists in the table.\nBeware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself.\n//Two-pass\nclass Solution {\n    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        Map map = new HashMap<>();\n        //fill in the hash table\n        for(int i = 0; i \nIt also can be done in one-pass.
