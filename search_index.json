Find that single one.\nExample 1:\nInput: [2,2,3,2]\nOutput: 3\nExample 2:\nInput: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]\nOutput: 99\nSOLUTION\nApproach: Bit Manipulation\nFor example, nums=[1, 2, 2, 1, 6, 2, 1].\nConvert each integer into binary, count the number of ones for each digit. Since every integer appears three times except the single one, the count numbers for each digit should be divided by 3.
